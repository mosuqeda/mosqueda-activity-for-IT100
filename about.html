       <p>Hi, I’m Carlos James Garay Mosqueda, an 18-year-old from Barangay 26, Purok 4, Gingoog City. I’m someone who values both challenges and fun, which reflects in my hobbies and interests.I love playing Mobile Legends during my free time, as it gives me a chance to relax while strategizing with friends. I’m also passionate about chess, a sport that sharpens my critical thinking and decision-making skills.

        Growing up, life hasn’t always been easy. Coming from a broken family, I’ve experienced hardships that shaped who I am today. These challenges taught me resilience, patience, and the importance of staying strong despite the odds. They also helped me appreciate the people around me and made me more determined to strive for a better future.
        
        I’m currently in a happy relationship, which brings me joy and balance in life. I believe that love and support from those close to us are essential in navigating life’s ups and downs.
        
        I’m a person who values growth, connection, and perseverance. Whether it’s improving my skills in chess, working through challenges, or cherishing moments with loved ones, I always aim to live life with purpose and positivity</p>

        <p>I started playing chess when I was a grade 12 student at GCCCNHS. I chose chess because I wanted to improve my critical thinking skills and decision-making abilities. Although I don't win all the time, I enjoy the challenge. When my mind is relaxed, I can sometimes defeat players from different countries, including some skilled Indian players. Chess has taught me the value of patience, strategy, and concentration. It’s not just a game, but a way to sharpen my mental focus. Over time, I’ve learned to stay calm under pressure, which helps me both in chess and in life.</p>
